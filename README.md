# Comics-Telegram-Bot

This repository contains the source code for 8bit_lives a telegram bot written using kotlin language.
The bot allows one to download comic books in form of .cbz (accepted/universal comic archive) right from telegram.
The project was written with the aim of understanding certain concepts of computer science, and perphaps the most
important concept enumerated in the project was the concept of a finite state machine.
A finite state machine in lay-man's terms simply means an object that given a set of inputs works on the said inputs
and returns the desired outputs.
Albeit, my implementation of finite state machine may be laced with novelty, and or crude, I had fun implementing it and I learnt a lot.
Please not, the project is far from perfect so for any bugs feel free to open an issue or ping me.
